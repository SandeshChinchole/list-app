# Studio71 Todo App

Refactoring:

1. Reorganized the application code by extracting out the components into separate files under "components" directory.
2. Replaced stateful class components with functional components for better code readability and maintainability.
3. Utilized modern React Hooks APIs to use state within functional components.
4. Refactored old JavaScript code with Modern ES6 code.
5. Fixed a bug that would cause the task text to overflow.
